this is my obsidian dump except it will be on github because pushing to a repo from my work laptop is satisfying. real-time notes from reading group sessions not cleaned up (yet).  
currently covering (heavy on):
parallelism
LLM training
compilers

ONLY clickety clacking if: the paper interesting and had questions (after homework pre-session). 
gained clarity on said tangents so articulation is fine for these.

htis is why most of my repos are (!)useless notes but i'll connect the dots between covered topics, relevant papers for future experiments (explore within team).  
something structured, but later.
